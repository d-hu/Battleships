Project 2: Battleships

Majority of the code was provided by professors.
Students are to utilize the files and create a bot.cpp program.

Goal: Create a bot.cpp program that implements an algorithm to take down the battleships.

Algorithm:
	This program starts from 0,0 and works through the board form left to right. 
	
	If HIT:
		-> Check for vertical ship and marks around it and the program avoids
		   those spots
	
		If Horizontal Ship:
		-> Mark "X"(HIT) all around it and the program avoids those spots
	
	If MISS: 
	->Mark current index with "MISS"

	If index is marked with either HIT or MISS 
	->Continue to the next unmarked index

With the makefile
	On linux : 
	In terminal in the Battleships directory, type: 
		"make all" to create executable objects
		"./battleships" will execute the program
		"make clean" to delete all objects.
